These are my dotfiles for configuring various tools.


## Fish Shell Scripts
Remember to do ```funcsave``` to save these scripts to fish's autoloader, or move them to your ```~/.config/fish``` directory.

- ```fish_greeting.fish``` displays some nice ascii art on startup
- ```fish_prompt.fish``` changes the prompt to be hostname, pwd, and a nice lambda symbol
